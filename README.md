Ferret
======

The Fast and Simple Responsive Framework for Rapid Development
---

The Ferret Framework is a fast and simple grid-based framework for rapid development. Ferret is 100% customizable, fully scalable, and built with LESS. Ferret also utilizes a custom grid that allows you to define how many columns make up the rows of the grid, giving you complete control of your project. You can have a 1 column grid, all the way up to a 24 column grid. And since Ferret is percentage based, you can even have an odd amount of grid columns such as 19 columns or 13 columns. 

Ferret works in all modern browsers, and even not so modern browsers like IE 8. Need support in IE 6 or 7? All you have to do is include the ie6-7 LESS stylesheet and boom... full IE support!
